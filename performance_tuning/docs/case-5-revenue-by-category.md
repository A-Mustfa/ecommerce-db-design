# üìä Case 5 ‚Äì Calculate Total Revenue per Category

## üìå Problem Statement
We needed to **calculate the total revenue per category** by joining multiple large tables (`CATEGORY`, `PRODUCT`, `ORDER_DETAILS`) and performing a heavy aggregation:  

```sql
SELECT
    C.category_id AS [category id],
    C.category_name AS [category name],
    SUM(OD.quantity * OD.unit_price) AS [total revenue]
FROM CATEGORY c
JOIN PRODUCT p ON C.category_id = P.category_id
JOIN ORDER_DETAILS OD ON P.product_id = OD.product_id
GROUP BY C.category_id, C.category_name
ORDER BY [total revenue] DESC;
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Issue:**  
- Query was **scanning huge tables** (especially `ORDER_DETAILS`) causing **high logical reads** and **longer CPU time**.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Before Optimization
**Query Stats:**
- **CATEGORY Table:** Logical Reads ~4
- **PRODUCT Table:** Logical Reads ~924
- **ORDER_DETAILS Table:** Logical Reads **21,405**
- **Execution Time:**  
  - **CPU Time:** ~1,219 ms  
  - **Elapsed Time:** ~645 ms

## üîß Optimization Applied
We applied **targeted indexes** to improve **JOIN performance** and **cover aggregations**:

```sql
-- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Index on Category (covering category_name for reporting)
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX idx_category_categoryid_includename
ON category (category_id)
INCLUDE (category_name);

-- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Index on Product (helps JOIN on category_id)
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX idx_product_categoryid
ON product (category_id);

-- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Covering Index on Order_Details (include needed columns for SUM)
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX idx_orderdetails_productid_include
ON order_details (product_id)
INCLUDE (quantity, unit_price);

```

## üöÄ After Optimization
**Query Stats:**
- **CATEGORY Table:** Logical Reads 4 (‚úÖ same ‚Äì already efficient)
- **PRODUCT Table:** Logical Reads **924** (‚úÖ fast join lookup)
- **ORDER_DETAILS Table:** Logical Reads **16,926** (‚¨á **-20%**)
- **Execution Time:**
  - **CPU Time:** **1,296 ms**
  - **Elapsed Time:** **332 ms** (‚âà **48% faster**)

## üìà Comparison Table

| Metric                | Before Index | After Index | Improvement |
| --------------------- | -----------: | ----------: | ----------: |
| ORDER_DETAILS Reads   | 21,405       | 16,926      | **-20%**    |
| CPU Time (ms)         | 1,219        | 1,296       | Slight ‚Üë (overhead for index maintenance) |
| Elapsed Time (ms)     | 645          | 332         | **~48% faster** |

## üí° What I Learned
‚úÖ **Joins speed up** dramatically when the foreign key columns are indexed (e.g., `product.category_id`, `order_details.product_id`).  
‚úÖ **INCLUDE columns** like `(quantity, unit_price)` prevent **extra key lookups**, making SUM calculations much faster.  
‚úÖ Logical Reads on the biggest table (`order_details`) dropped by **20%**, showing that **covering indexes** make a real impact.

‚úÖ **Case 5 demonstrates how smart indexing on join keys + covering columns can turn a heavy reporting query into a much faster one.**
